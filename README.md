## **Purpose of the Project**
This project was created as part of a practical exercise to:
- Implement fundamental Java concepts such as file handling, object-oriented programming, and exception handling.
- Develop a simple yet functional parking lot management system.
- Improve problem-solving and logic-building skills through real-world applications.
- Provide a foundational system that can be expanded with a GUI or database integration in the future.
